# Synthy

[Goal]

The goal of this project was to make a small and entertaining web app which allows the user
to play a synthesizer keyboard in their browser. The idea would be that not only the syntehizer,
but other planned modules would be moveable, resizable, and be able to be placed wherever is
comfortable for the user.

Besides the synthesizer keyboard, drum loop and sound effects modules were planned however due
to time constraints, they most likely will not be implemented and only the synthezier will be
polished up and allow for sound tweaking.

Another goal that may still be implemented in the future is to have the background images cycle
to other images with a vaporwave aesthetic or have visual effects occur when different notes or
chords are played.

[Current Status]

Currently upon opening the HTML page, a modern 2 octave keyboard UI is visible which has all
notes and keyboard shortcuts labeled on it. By either mouse clicks or keyboard presses notes
will be played or can be sustained by holding keys down. The synth module is currently movable
but not resizable and has set dimensions.
